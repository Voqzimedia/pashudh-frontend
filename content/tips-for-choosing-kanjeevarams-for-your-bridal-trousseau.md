You want to be the centre of attraction on your special day, but not for the wrong reasons. Here are a few pointers to keep in mind while choosing a Kanjeevaram pattu saree for your wedding day:

Tip #1

Buy your Kanjeevaram silk saree from a trusted and recognized seller or weaver. The Kanjeevaram saree demonstrates the true artistic skill of our land. Like all things magnificent, even this art has become prone to fake or adulterated versions cropping up to satisfy the commercial needs of the public. So make sure that the saree you are purchasing is an unadulterated Kanchipuram silk saree.

Tip #2

Ask for the kind of Kanjeevaram silk saree that you are buying – whether it is made of pure zari and pure silk, or of silk/polyester mix and pure zari, or half-fine zari and pure silk. The pure zari and pure silk weaves are the original Kanchipuram sarees and the most expensive, and the parts are weaved together using three silk threads. So brides, be careful and do not compromise on quality!

Tip #3

Your wedding saree is an investment and an asset for a lifetime. Take some time out and do your research on the design and colour you want before hunting for it. Opting for the right shade makes a big difference. A shade too dark or too light can take away the saree’s entire aura and change the way you will look on your big day! Also, do remember to check the colour of the saree in daylight while out shopping, as the actual colour would be visible only then.

Tip #4

While the bridal Kanjeevaram will set you a class apart in itself, the bridal look is incomplete without the right jewellery and hair accessories that would brighten up your entire look! That said, one cannot go overboard by trying to catch up with various trends and styles all at once. There is nothing more beautiful and elegant than traditional gold jewellery. Also, opt for a Kamarbandh or the ‘Oddiyanam’, which, when worn with a saree, completes the classic Indian bridal look.

Tip #5

While the Kanjeevaram saree is usually non-embellished, there’s no one stopping you from going for an intricately designed and contrasting blouse! It is your day, and everyone’s eyes will be on you! A personalized blouse will be an absolute stunner. It has always been a trendsetter and also something that your better half would be thrilled to see. There are other styles such as a modern blouse, a peplum blouse, a puff-sleeved blouse, and many more that a bride can have her pick from.

All that being said, we would like for our brides to always remember the fact that comfort is of utmost priority on the wedding day. So, make sure that whatever style you are opting for, you feel comfortable. Lastly, we would love to see you all dolled up on your big day, so don’t forget to share some pictures and your experience with us at care@pashudh.com
