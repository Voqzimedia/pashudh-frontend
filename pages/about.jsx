              Pashudh was born out of a passion to celebrate the glorious silk
              traditions of our land and embrace contemporary trends. Pure,
              authentic Kanjeevaram that has been treasured by generations of
              women needs to make its way into the wardrobes of new-age women
              who follow haute couture as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began 40 years ago in Arni, a town in Tamil Nadu that
              is renowned for its rich legacy of silk sarees. Pashudh was
              founded by the brothers - KK Rajkumar, KK Sureshkumar and KV Kumar
              whose entrepreneurial skills and fascination for silk made Pashudh
              a name to reckon with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr KV Kumar has proven his business acumen by establishing key
              partnerships with retailers all over the country. He is also an
              illustrious designer whose creations have flown off the shelves.
              By keeping abreast of new developments in technology, trends and
              customer demands, he has been the driving force behind the brandâ€™s
              success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our story is also that of the revival of weaving communities. We
              have an award-winning team of 750 weavers, many of whom belonging
              to families that have been in the trade for generations. We
              combine conventional methods of weaving with more recent
              techniques as well. All our sarees are lovingly woven by hand, and
              proudly draped by lovely women all over the world.
